# Lib
This folder is the root of all the pages that the app uses, all of which are stored in the folders *models*, *pages* and *widgets*.  
This folder also contains two files:
* *main.dart* - The starting point of the app. This creates the framework that the app runs from and also initiates some vital components like the connection to Firebase.
* *main_copy.dart* - A copy of main.dart that is used when running two emulators using the app.
