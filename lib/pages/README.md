# Pages
This folder contains all app pages. The main and shared pages are kept in this folder, while pages unique to either the phone or tablet sides of the app are stored in their respective folders.
The files contained in this folder are:
* *call_page.dart* - The page that displays video and outputs audio for both sides of the app when calling between them
* *create_account_page.dart* - A page accessible from the login page where new users can create an account

* *message_page.dart* - A page used by both sides of the app to send messages between each other
* *phone_main.dart* - The main page of the phone side of the app. A scaffold that the other phone pages use.
* *tablet_main.dart* - The main page of the tablet side of the app. Works like a home page.
