What I've learned

The aim of the project was to create a digital assistant for an office door that would allow the owner to communicate and display information to anyone outside their office.  
Several similar products exists on the market, but they are more focused on managing entire work spaces.
What makes this project stand out is that it is aimed at managing offices for individuals, rather than managing work spaces and rooms for corporations.
It can be utilised by as few as a single office worker, and by as many as an entire corporation.  
The impact the project has is that it shrinks the time it takes to communicate with i.e. a lecturer from a day or two via email, to a quick message or a call.
It also makes booking meetings and getting up to date information accessible and easy.
I have learnt so much during this project, and have had the opportunity to grow as a data scientist using the newest technology in app development.
