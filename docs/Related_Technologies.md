## Main Takeaway
Looking at all of these related products, they do mostly the same things. Booking desks to work at,  
booking meeting rooms, displaying information on different rooms and welcoming visitors.  
My Capstone project does not share a lot of these functions, but some of these could be added to  
the project in the future. I will definitely draw upon their designs for inspiration, but other than  
that there isn't really that much to draw from them.  
I can however use them to highlight where this project will be different.
