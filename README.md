### Capstone Project 2021/2022, University of Essex
This is the repository of my Capstone Project undertaken as my final year project at the  
University of Essex in the academic year 2021/2022.  
The project was under the supervision of Dr. Shoaib Jameel.

## Project Description
The goal of the project was to create an app that would replace the traditional door signs of  
office doors with an interactive application that staff at the school could use to signal to  
anyone outside their office whether they are available or not. With additional functionalities like  
messaging, calling, booking meetings and more.

The finished project has evolved beyond its original scope of only being implemented in a school  
environment to an application that is industry ready. It can be implemented by as few as a single  
person in a workplace to as many as the entire work force of a corporation.  

## Project Features
* An easy and intuitive way for the office owner to signal of they are available/busy or in/out of
office. This provides a visitor a clear picture of what action to take when arriving at their door.
* A quick and convenient way for a person at the door to communicate with the office owner via
instant messaging. Messages are sent and received almost instantly through the online database.
* A stable and fast way to have a video conversation through the two sides of the app. A
visitor can easily request a video call when outside the office if necessary.
* A robust meeting booking system that interfaces with the office owners calendar to give someone
who want to meet them a good picture of when they are available, and a way to book a meeting 
through the app.
* A minimalistic and efficient user interface that is easy to navigate and understand, and gives
the users of both sides of the app the functionality needed to accomplish what they need to do.
* A safe and secure login system that stores the personal data safely and encrypted in the cloud.
* An account creation that supports users that want to build their account from scratch, or
import data from their Microsoft account to build their info from.
