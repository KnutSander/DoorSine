# My Capstone Project.
### Welcome one and all to my Capstone Project!
The purpose of this project is to digitise the name signs outside your office and add useful  
functionalities to it, both for the owner of the office and whoever is outside the office.  
The app is created with a school location in mind, but could be used in similar situations as well.

## Main goals
### Staff
- Set their availability as to not be disturbed
- Let someone outside their door if they are in or out of office
- Set available times for meetings based on their calender schedule
- Reply to quick messages from someone outside their office
- Share their contact info with people who arrive at their office

### Student
- Find out if the staff they are looking for is available
- See if the staff they are looking for is in their office or not
- Request meetings with the staff based on the staffs availability
- Send the staff quick messages with small questions
- Get the staffs contact info if needed

## Stretch Goals
These goals are pretty out there, but I would like to attempt them at some point.
- Log in system for users outside the door
- Search for lecturers, to find their office or contact them via the tablet currently being used
- QR code that can be scanned to open the email app on the users phone to send the staff an email
